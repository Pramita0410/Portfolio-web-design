                <td>I led a team of five in the collection and profiling of 4 million records from a variety of sources, utilizing Alteryx to streamline the process. I was responsible for designing an effective Entity-Relationship (ER) model, significantly reducing data redundancy by 3 times through meticulous cleaning and normalization. Additionally, I orchestrated 23 Talend workflows to ensure efficient data integration into various relational databases. This process was enhanced with robust logging mechanisms, allowing for thorough monitoring and assessment of data operations. Demonstrating advanced dashboarding skills, I utilized Tableau and Power BI to create 20 dynamic dashboards. These dashboards were built using complex SQL queries and effectively showcased key insights, contributing significantly to data-driven decision-making in the organization.</td>

This automation involved efficiently pulling data from five distinct sources, streamlining the process and improving overall efficiency. Additionally, I engineered a robust data pipeline specifically for cleansing and integrating over 50,000 records into Azure Cosmos DB. This effort greatly enhanced data availability and reliability. To further improve operational efficiency, I automated the generation of reports using Power BI, optimizing them with DAX queries. This automation resulted in a substantial reduction in report preparation time, cutting it down by 30%, thereby enabling more timely and effective data analysis and decision-making.</td>

I also developed a custom Alteryx plugin in Python, efficiently processing over 100,000 rows of data for enhanced accuracy in data manipulation and cleansing. Further elevating our data visualization capabilities, I integrated Grafana to create interactive dashboards, effectively displaying key economic indicators and trends. This multifaceted approach not only streamlined our data analysis processes but also provided valuable insights for informed decision-making.</td>

My primary responsibility was to build a Random Forest model to develop a sophisticated prediction system. Through rigorous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of advanced statistical techniques, I successfully improved the model's accuracy by 12%. Additionally, I utilized Microsoft Excel to analyze over 50,000 data points. This analysis involved creating diverse and informative plots, including heat maps and histograms, which significantly enhanced the clarity and comprehensibility of our reports by 30%. This project not only improved the accuracy of predictive modeling in the biomedical field but also enhanced the effectiveness of data communication and decision-making processes.</td>
